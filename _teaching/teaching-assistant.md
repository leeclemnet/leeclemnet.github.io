    description: This course is intended to provide an introduction and a very interdisciplinary experience to robotics.  The structure of the course is modular and reflects the perception-control-action paradigm of robotics.  The course, however, aims for breadth, covering an introduction to the key aspects of general robotic systems, rather than depth, which is available in later more advanced courses.  Applications addressed include robotics in space, autonomous terrestrial exploration, biomedical applications such as surgery and assistive robots, and personal robotics.  The course culminates in a hardware project centered on robot integration.
