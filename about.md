Hi there! I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in the <a href="//starslab.ca/">Space and Terrestrial Autonomous Robotic Systems Lab</a> (STARS) at the <a href="//utias.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies</a> (UTIAS), advised by <a href="//jonathankelly.info">Prof. Jonathan Kelly</a>.
My research interests include mobile robotics, state estimation, computer vision and machine learning.
<p>
</p>
I'm originally from <a href="//www.google.ca/maps/place/Winnipeg,+MB">Winnipeg, Manitoba</a> (affectionately: Winterpeg, Manisnowba).
In my spare time I can often be found soaking up Toronto's vibrant music scene, perfecting my sourdough, or binge-listening to podcasts.
