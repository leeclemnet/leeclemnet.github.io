Hi there! My name is Lee and I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in the Space and Terrestrial Autonomous Robotic Systems (<a href="http://stars.utias.utoronto.ca/">STARS</a>) Lab at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies (<a href="http://utias.utoronto.ca/">UTIAS</a>). I hold two Bachelor's degrees from the <a href="http://umanitoba.ca">University of Manitoba</a>, one in Commerce (B.Comm.) and one in Physics and Computer Science (B.Sc.).

My current research focus is on developing robust multi-sensor navigation algorithms for a variety of autonomous vehicles. Together with my advisor, <a href="http://jonathankelly.info">Professor Jonathan Kelly</a>, I'm working on developing a dense visual-inertial mapping and localization system capable of highly accurate and robust tracking over vast distances.

Apart from research, I currently serve as Director of Finance for Students for the Exploration and Development of Space &ndash; Canada (<a href="http://seds.ca">SEDS-Canada</a>), a national student-led organization dedicated to improving the Canadian space sector. In my spare time I can often be found soaking up Toronto's vibrant music scene and binge-watching Netflix.
