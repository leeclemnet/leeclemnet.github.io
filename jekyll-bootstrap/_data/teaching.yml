  title: Self-Driving Cars Specialization
  role: Subject Matter Expert
  terms: 2018
  description: This Specialization provides a comprehensive understanding of state-of-the-art engineering practices used in the self-driving car industry. Learners interact with real data sets from an autonomous vehicle through hands-on projects using the open source simulator CARLA. As a Subject Matter Expert, I helped create and script video lectures on topics in State Estimation and Localization for Self-Driving Cars.

  title: Introduction to Robotics
  role: Teaching Assistant
  terms: Fall 2015-18
  description: This course is intended to provide an introduction and a very interdisciplinary experience to robotics.  The structure of the course is modular and reflects the perception-control-action paradigm of robotics. Applications addressed include robotics in space, autonomous terrestrial exploration, biomedical applications such as surgery and assistive robots, and personal robotics.  The course culminates in a hardware project centered on robot integration.
