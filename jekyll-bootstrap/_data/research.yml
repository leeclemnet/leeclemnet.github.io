  description: The world around us is constantly changing. Robots need tools for coping with environmental change if they are to operate autonomously over long periods of time without human intervention.

- title: Deep Learning as a Sensor

  description: Deep learning is a powerful tool, but only one of many in the roboticist's toolbox. By thinking about deep learning as a kind of extra sensor, we can combine it with existing tools to make robots work better.

- title: Sensor Fusion & Estimation

  description: Real-world robots rely on a suite of sensors to understand the world around them. To fuse all of this data into a consistent belief, we need careful sensor calibration and probabilistic models.
