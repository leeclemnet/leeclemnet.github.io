    Hi! I'm a final-year Ph.D. Candidate in the <a href="//starslab.ca/" target="_blank">Space and Terrestrial Autonomous Robotic Systems Lab</a> (STARS) at the <a href="//utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">University of Toronto</a>, where I'm advised by <a href="//jonathankelly.info" target="_blank">Prof. Jonathan Kelly</a>. I'm also a Postgraduate Affiliate of the <a href="//vectorinstitute.ai" target="_blank">Vector Institute</a> in Toronto.
    My research focuses on the intersection of machine learning and robotics with an emphasis on deep learning for visual localization.
    More broadly, I'm interested in the ethics of data and automation, and the intersection of technology and society, particularly approaches that center the impacts of technology on marginalized communities. 
    I have lectured on topics in robotics, state estimation, computer vision and machine learning at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and co-created the State Estimation and Localization course of the <a href="//www.coursera.org/specializations/self-driving-cars" target="_blank">Coursera Self-Driving Car specialization</a>.
  </p>

  <p> 
    I'm originally from <a href="//www.google.ca/maps/place/Winnipeg,+MB" target="_blank">Winnipeg, Manitoba</a> (affectionately: Winterpeg, Manisnowba).
    In my spare time I can often be found soaking up Toronto's vibrant music scene, perfecting my sourdough, or binge-listening to podcasts.
