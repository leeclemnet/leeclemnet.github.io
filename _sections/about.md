    Hi! I work on autonomy systems at <a href="//oxbotica.ai">Oxbotica</a> in Toronto.
  </p>
  <p>
    I earned my Ph.D. at the <a href="//utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">University of Toronto</a>, where I was advised by <a href="//jonathankelly.info" target="_blank">Prof. Jonathan Kelly</a> and was a Postgraduate Affiliate of the <a href="//vectorinstitute.ai" target="_blank">Vector Institute</a>. 
    My doctoral research focused on combining deep learning with traditional state estimation tools for long-term visual navigation.
    I have lectured on topics in robotics, state estimation, computer vision and machine learning at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and co-created the State Estimation and Localization course of the <a href="//www.coursera.org/specializations/self-driving-cars" target="_blank">Coursera Self-Driving Cars Specialization</a>.
    I was lucky to be the only Canadian selected for the inaugural cohort of the <a href="http://sites.google.com/view/rsspioneers2018/">RSS Pioneers</a> program in 2018 and had the privilege of mentoring junior students as part of <a href="http://rislab.github.io/rss2018website/attending/inclusion/">Inclusion@RSS</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm broadly interested in the ethics of data and automation and the intersection of technology and society, as well as feminist, queer, and trans critiques of engineering research and practice.
