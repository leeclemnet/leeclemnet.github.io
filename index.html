Hi there! I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in the Space and Terrestrial Autonomous Robotic Systems (<a href="http://starslab.ca/">STARS</a>) Lab at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies (<a href="http://utias.utoronto.ca/">UTIAS</a>). Originally from Winnipeg, Manitoba (affectionately: Winterpeg, Manisnowba), I hold two Bachelor's degrees from the <a href="http://umanitoba.ca">University of Manitoba</a>, one in Commerce (B.Comm.) and the other in Physics and Computer Science (B.Sc.).

My current research focus is on developing robust visual navigation algorithms for autonomous vehicles. Together with my advisor, <a href="http://jonathankelly.info">Professor Jonathan Kelly</a>, I am investigating how we can reason over more than just the geometry of an environment to improve visual navigation for autonomous robotic vehicles.
</p>
<p>
Apart from research, I currently serve on the Board of Directors for Students of the Exploration and Development of Space &ndash; Canada (<a href="http://seds.ca">SEDS-Canada</a>), a national student-run not-for-profit organization dedicated to improving the Canadian space sector. I am also a Teaching Assistant for two undergraduate robotics courses, ROB 301 (Introduction to Robotics) and AER 521 (Mobile Robotics and Perception). In my spare time I can often be found soaking up Toronto's vibrant music scene and binge-watching Netflix.
