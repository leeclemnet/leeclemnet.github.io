Hi there! I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in the Space and Terrestrial Autonomous Robotic Systems (<a href="http://stars.utias.utoronto.ca/">STARS</a>) Lab at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies (<a href="http://utias.utoronto.ca/">UTIAS</a>). Originally from Winnipeg, Manitoba (affectionately: Winterpeg, Manisnowba), I hold two Bachelor's degrees from the <a href="http://umanitoba.ca">University of Manitoba</a>, one in Commerce (B.Comm.) and the other in Physics and Computer Science (B.Sc.).

My current research focus is on developing robust visual navigation algorithms for autonomous vehicles. Together with my advisor, <a href="http://jonathankelly.info">Professor Jonathan Kelly</a>, I'm working on developing a dense visual mapping and localization system capable of highly accurate and robust tracking in large-scale environments under lighting and appearance changes.
</p>
<p>
Apart from research, I currently serve as Director of Finance for Students for the Exploration and Development of Space &ndash; Canada (<a href="http://seds.ca">SEDS-Canada</a>), a national student-run non-profit dedicated to improving the Canadian space sector. I am also a Teaching Assistant for two undergraduate robotics courses, ROB 301 (Introduction to Robotics) and AER 521 (Mobile Robotics and Perception). In my spare time I can often be found soaking up Toronto's vibrant music scene and binge-watching Netflix.
