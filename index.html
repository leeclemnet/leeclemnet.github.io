        Hi there! My name is Lee and I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in the Space and Terrestrial Autonomous Robotic Systems (<a href="http://starslab.ca/">STARS</a>)
        Lab at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies (<a href="http://utias.utoronto.ca/">UTIAS</a>).
        Originally from Winnipeg, Manitoba (affectionately: Winterpeg, Manisnowba), I hold two Bachelor's degrees from the
        <a href="http://umanitoba.ca">University of Manitoba</a>, one in Commerce (B.Comm.) and the other in Physics and
        Computer Science (B.Sc.).
    </p>

    <p>
        My research lies at the interface of computer vision and machine learning, with a view to developing robust visual navigation
        algorithms for autonomous vehicles. Together with my advisor, <a href="http://jonathankelly.info">Professor Jonathan Kelly</a>,
        I am currently investigating how we can use machine learning to reason over more than just the geometry of an environment
        and improve visual navigation for autonomous robotic vehicles.
    </p>
    <p>
        Apart from research, I am currently a Teaching Assistant for ROB 301 (Introduction to Robotics) and will be a Course Instructor
        for AER 521 (Mobile Robotics and Perception) in the Winter 2018 term. I am also the (co-)President of the UTIAS
        <a
            href="http://arrow.utias.utoronto.ca/~asa/">Aerospace Students Association</a>. I previously served on the Board of Directors for Students of the Exploration
            and Development of Space &ndash; Canada (<a href="http://seds.ca">SEDS-Canada</a>), a national student-run not-for-profit
            organization dedicated to improving the Canadian space sector. In my spare time I can often be found soaking
            up Toronto's vibrant music scene and binge-watching Netflix.
